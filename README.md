## ABOUT
<br>
Crypto Kaktos is a collection of 1000 unique ERC-1155 tokens stored on the Polygon Blockchain.
<br>
<br>
## THE STORY
<br>
It's been 24 weeks since a small group of Arizona plant geneticists were struck by a devastating haboob while performing top secret experiments at KAKTOS Labs near the Estrella Mountains. During the catastrophic dust storm, the rooftop over one of the experimental labs housing a level-X project by the name of CRYPTO KAKTOS, was ripped apart and 1000 germinating e-seeds were dispersed all over the Metaverse.
<br>
Recently the geneticists have designed an easy to use web application, using smart contract technology, to safely gather up the now adolescent thorny plants and return them to the research facility. When a CRYPTO KAKTOS is minted or attained, the NFT will be used as an automated access key to KAKTOS Labs. What happens next will forever change reality...
